## [RS School React Course](https://rs.school/courses/reactjs): React Forms Project

This project is a React application that demonstrates the implementation of two different approaches to building forms: one using uncontrolled components and the other using React Hook Form. The application utilizes React Portals to display these forms within accessible and reusable modal components.
